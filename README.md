Dank Mode Teal is a clean, modern and nearly vanilla pack that is dedicated to keeping your focus where it needs to be, the game, with some heady elements added for flair. Taking some of the best elements of Nord + Dark Vanilla, DMT was lovingly crafted with Dark Mode Supremacy in mind, and flawless in any client layout.
